# Guess The Flag
Simple app developed using **Swift** which tests the users' knowledge about flags from around the world.

The app uses one view which updates after every user interaction, such as tapping the correct or incorrect flag.

My main target with this project was learning more about views and UI.

The score updates after every correct guess and it resets back to zero when the score surpasses 9.
